		      INTRODUCTION
		    </h2>
		    <p>
		      Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the second
		      son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute, and of
		      Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were members of the
		      old Florentine nobility.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      His life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly
		      enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of
		      Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an
		      Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de' Medici, Il Magnifico. The
		      downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year
		      Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career
		      Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted until
		      1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his office.
		      The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they were once
		      more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli's literary activity
		      and increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks of the expulsion
		      of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighth year, without having
		      regained office.

		    <h2>
		      YOUTH &mdash; Aet. 1-25&mdash;1469-94
		    </h2>
		    <p>
		      Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the
		      Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of this
		      representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been described
		      as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by the fervent
		      and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving Lorenzo.
		      Savonarola's influence upon the young Machiavelli must have been slight,
		      for although at one time he wielded immense power over the fortunes of
		      Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a gibe in "The
		      Prince," where he is cited as an example of an unarmed prophet who came to
		      a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean rule during the life
		      of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli strongly, for he
		      frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to Lorenzo's grandson
		      that he dedicates "The Prince."
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      Machiavelli, in his "History of Florence," gives us a picture of the young
		      men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: "They were freer than
		      their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other kinds of
		      excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming, and women;
		      their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with wit and
		      acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly was thought
		      the wisest." In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli shows why youth
		      should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leads us to infer
		      that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes: "I have received your
		      letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure, especially because you
		      tell me you are quite restored in health, than which I could have no
		      better news; for if God grant life to you, and to me, I hope to make a
		      good man of you if you are willing to do your share." Then, writing of a
		      new patron, he continues: "This will turn out well for you, but it is
		      necessary for you to study; since, then, you have no longer the excuse of
		      illness, take pains to study letters and music, for you see what honour is
		      done to me for the little skill I have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to
		      please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and
		      study, because others will help you if you help yourself."

		    <h2>
		      OFFICE &mdash; Aet. 25-43&mdash;1494-1512
		    </h2>
		    <p>
		      The second period of Machiavelli's life was spent in the service of the
		      free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the
		      expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After serving
		      four years in one of the public offices he was appointed Chancellor and
		      Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and Peace. Here we
		      are on firm ground when dealing with the events of Machiavelli's life, for
		      during this time he took a leading part in the affairs of the Republic,
		      and we have its decrees, records, and dispatches to guide us, as well as
		      his own writings. A mere recapitulation of a few of his transactions with
		      the statesmen and soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his
		      activities, and supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences
		      and characters which illustrate "The Prince."
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      His first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, "my lady of Forli" of
		      "The Prince," from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it is far
		      better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on fortresses.
		      This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is urged by him in
		      many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      In 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for
		      continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct of
		      affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft
		      summarized in "The Prince," and was consequently driven out. He, also, it
		      was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support to
		      Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge that
		      such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the faith
		      of princes.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      Machiavelli's public life was largely occupied with events arising out of
		      the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the Duke
		      Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of "The Prince."
		      Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke for the
		      benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have seized; he can,
		      indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the pattern of Cesare
		      Borgia's conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed by some critics as the
		      "hero" of "The Prince." Yet in "The Prince" the duke is in point of fact
		      cited as a type of the man who rises on the fortune of others, and falls
		      with them; who takes every course that might be expected from a prudent
		      man but the course which will save him; who is prepared for all
		      eventualities but the one which happens; and who, when all his abilities
		      fail to carry him through, exclaims that it was not his fault, but an
		      extraordinary and unforeseen fatality.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      On the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to watch
		      the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia cheated into
		      allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano delle Rovere
		      (Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most reason to fear the
		      duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election, says that he who
		      thinks new favours will cause great personages to forget old injuries
		      deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had ruined Cesare.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      It was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that pontiff
		      was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought to a
		      successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing chiefly to
		      his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius that
		      Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and women, and
		      concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win
		      and hold them both.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      It is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian
		      states, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany, with
		      results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those events,
		      and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they impinge on
		      the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with Louis XII of
		      France, and his estimate of that monarch's character has already been
		      alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as the man who
		      accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but who in reality
		      had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who, had he allowed
		      himself to be influenced by such motives, would have been ruined. The
		      Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men of the age, and his
		      character has been drawn by many hands; but Machiavelli, who was an envoy
		      at his court in 1507-8, reveals the secret of his many failures when he
		      describes him as a secretive man, without force of character&mdash;ignoring
		      the human agencies necessary to carry his schemes into effect, and never
		      insisting on the fulfilment of his wishes.
